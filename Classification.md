## Classification — ACM & AMS

This chapter positions the research within established taxonomies to clarify the technical scope and intended scholarly audience. The system is an applied NLP and affective computing contribution with a focus on sentiment/emotion analysis, interactive retrieval, and neural architectures.

### ACM Computing Classification System (CCS)
- Computing methodologies → Natural language processing → Sentiment analysis  
- Computing methodologies → Artificial intelligence → Natural language processing  
- Information systems → Information retrieval → Users and interactive retrieval  

### AMS Mathematics Subject Classification
- 68T07 Artificial neural networks and deep learning  
- 68T50 Natural language processing  

### Rationale
- **Sentiment analysis / emotion recognition**: Core task of mapping text to discrete affective states.  
- **Interactive retrieval**: The chatbot setting involves turn-by-turn exchanges where user intent and affect guide response retrieval.  
- **Neural methods**: The primary model is a BERT-based encoder fine-tuned for classification, augmented with rule-based overrides.  

By grounding the work in these classifications, the chapter signals relevance to communities focused on applied NLP, human–computer interaction, and efficient deployment of deep models under practical constraints.
